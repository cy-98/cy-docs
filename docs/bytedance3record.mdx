## Bytedance 3 years recod

joined TikTok from graduation and major in frontend development in 2021.

Completed promotion and made two friends with a little girl and a old boy.

Life in Bytedance is hurried and exicted, Eveyone has clear goal. Work in here enhanced skills in all aspects, such as written expression and group cooperation.The biggest gain is that I have exercised my mind and make it stronger.
I learned to let go of certain things and enjoy life.

During the final period, I met more friends, eating, chatting even drinking with them. I also tried to make friends outside bytedance, and it's funny.

Thanks to my leader's help in work and life. Thanks to frineds have accompained through these time.

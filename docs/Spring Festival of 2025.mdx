# Spring Festival of 2025

> 2024 passed and 2025 is coming. How time flys that I am not young anymore.

Every time I go back home, many emotinal thoughts and things gona happen and make me think a lot.
It's hard to say the reason why I was always emotional. These feelings have been with me from very early until now. 
I always be angary if I repeat something to parents.

When we seat together includes my grandparents, I found everyone would like to ask somebody else to follow their mind and try to teach
others by a rough tone.
Parents always ask me something that they don't understand at all.

It's so hard to explain I was almost 27 years old and make decision by myself.

It's so hard to ask them keep healthy and abandon bad habit.

It's so hard to teach them what I learned from modern society.

And everytime emotional mind breed, I yell to parents and regretful. Sometimes I thinks it's a simple way to resolve problems.
And I gradually understand I was treat like this when was a child.
What's the correct way of communication with parents? Anyone can help me to make the progress to the end?
What's the differents between me and parents? And between me and bro?
So many problems make me trouble.

It was another person when I live in home, maybe.

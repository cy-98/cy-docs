# E person 

> It's popular recently that a person juged by two types. E person get satisfaction from others and I person get from himself.

I think I born with the E type even I am not good at social contact. I need others laugh, sharing and accompany.
Actually, it was a hope for these and keeping away from lonely.
I'm trying to become a classical E person, learning how to chat online, provide emotial value and feel others feelings.
And finally found I'm really not good at these :(

I'm not a good E person for I never chat with someone online before. Then I found someone never chat with me now 0.0
Now let me make a plan to how to improve my E skills, ( now I was a P person ).

I should chat with strangers as much as possible.

I should contact shcoolmates for a long time lost.

I should listen carefully feel what they feels when friends talked about something.

I should care about familys and friends in some festivals. Asking anything need help.

Intersting.
